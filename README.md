# 100daysOfCode_projectOne
My first project in the 100daysofcode challenge.

Ended after 17 hours of coding (13 days)
with not really a particular goal

My only goals was making a platformer in pygame and learning new stuff about coding in general

The things I have learned from this project:

The importance of design and the layout of OOP
Now that I know this I can make code way more compacter, easier to read and less buggier.

Maths and Physics
I've learned a few things about physics

The pygame library
I've learned some documentation of the pygame library


Conclusion:
I'm happy with what I learned in project one
I will take the mistakes and experiences I learned in project one to project two
to create better and smoother programs
