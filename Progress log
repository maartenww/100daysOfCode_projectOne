Progress log:

LEGEND:
'+' = New feature

Day1:  (1 hour)
  + Finished the window and the ability to close it.


Day2: (3.5 hours)
GOALS: menu, movement, background
Movement: Partially done (Left and right movement)
Menu: didn't get to it
Background: Partially done (Black background)

  + Added a yellow cube as character and the ability to move left and right.

NOTE:
      In earlier versions of the code you also had the ability to move up and down but then it would be a top-down view game
      instead of a 2d platformer where you usually look at the game sideways.
      And with me trying to add jumping and acceleration this significantly halted my progress.
      However I did learn a thing or two.

Thoughts:
      This day was stressful as I had some problems with trying to get vectors to work.
      Making my program more unstable than earlier versions.
